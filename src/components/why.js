                <p className="why-text">The Porter Scene in Macbeth serves as a <span className="bold">comic relief</span>, juxtaposing the play's dark themes with humor. It highlights the theme of appearance versus reality, as the Porter pretends to be the gatekeeper of hell, while the audience knows that Duncan has just been murdered. This scene also emphasizes the consequences of ambition and guilt, as Macbeth's actions lead to chaos and disorder. Additionally, it foreshadows the unraveling of Macbeth's sanity and the moral decay that follows his ascent to power.</p>
